      <h2 id="fruits">Fruits</h2>
      <p>
        <img class="size03 float-left padding-right" src="assets/images/AboutPic2.jpeg"
          alt="various types of fruits" />
        Plant scientists have classified fruits into three main groups: simple
        fruits, aggregate fruits, and multiple (or composite) fruits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simple fleshy fruits from apples to berries to watermelon; simple dry
        fruits including beans and rice, coconuts and carrots; aggregate
        fruits including strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, pawpaw;
        multiple fruits such as pineapple, fig, mulberries; (see above re
        all)â€” are commercially valuable as human food. They are eaten both
        fresh and as jams, marmalade and other fruit preserves. They are used
        extensively in manufactured and processed foods (cakes, cookies, baked
        goods, flavorings, ice cream, yogurt, canned vegetables, frozen
        vegetables and meals) and beverages such as fruit juices and alcoholic
        beverages (brandy, fruit beer, wine). Spices like vanilla, black
        pepper, paprika, and allspice are derived from berries. Olive fruit is
        pressed for olive oil and similar processing is applied to other oil
        bearing fruits/vegetables.
      </p>
      <p>
        Various culinary fruits provide significant amounts of fiber and water
        and present significant resistance to chewing; many are generally high
        in vitamin C. An overview of numerous studies show that fruits (e.g.,
        whole apples or whole oranges) are very satisfying (filling) in the
        acts of simply eating and chewing them. The fiber consumed in eating
        fruit promote satiety and help to control weight gain and to provide
        cholesterol-lowering effects. Regular consumption of fruit is
        generally associated with reduced risks of several diseases and
        functional declines associated with aging. A current review for
        meta-analyses concludes that even current assessments might
        significantly underestimate the protective associations of regularly
        eating fruits and vegetables.

      <p>
        <img class="size02 float-left padding-right" src="./assets/images/grains-legumes-nuts-seeds-01.jpg"

        A grain is a small, hard, dry seed - with or without an attached hull
        or fruit layer - harvested for human or animal consumption. After
        being harvested, dry grains are more durable than other staple foods,
        such as starchy fruits (plantains, breadfruit, etc.) and tubers (sweet
        potatoes, cassava, and more). This durability has made grains well
        suited to industrial agriculture, since they can be mechanically
        harvested, transported by rail or ship, stored for long periods in
        silos, and milled for flour or pressed for oil. Thus, major global
        commodity markets exist for maize, rice, soybeans, wheat and other
        grains but not for tubers, vegetables, or other crops.

        Legumes are a significant source of protein, dietary fiber,
        carbohydrates and dietary minerals; for example, a 100 gram serving of
        cooked chickpeas contains 18 percent of the Daily Value (DV) for
        protein, 30 percent DV for dietary fiber, 43 percent DV for folate and
        52 percent DV for manganese. Legumes are also an excellent source of
        resistant starch which is broken down by bacteria in the large
        intestine to produce short-chain fatty acids (such as butyrate) used
        by intestinal cells for food energy.

        Nuts contain the diverse nutrients that are needed for the growth of a
        new plant. Composition varies, but they tend to have a low water and
        carbohydrate content, with high levels of fats, protein, dietary
        minerals, and vitamins. The digestibility of the protein at about 90%
        is slightly lower than that of meat and fish, but can be improved by
        thorough chewing. The fats are largely unsaturated and nuts are a
        source of essential omega-3 fatty acids. As part of a healthy human
        diet, long-term consumption of diverse nutrients in nuts may
        contribute to a lower risk of cardiovascular diseases, reduced levels
        of blood cholesterol, and lower all-cause mortality. For vegetarians
        and vegans, nuts provide many of the essential nutrients which may be
        in short supply in other plant foods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nuts are the source of energy and nutrients for the new plant. They
        contain a relatively large quantity of calories, essential unsaturated
        and monounsaturated fats including linoleic acid and linolenic acid,
        vitamins, and essential amino acids. Many nuts are good sources of
        vitamin E, vitamin B2, folate, fiber, and essential minerals, such as
        magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, copper, and selenium.

        An edible seed is a seed that is suitable for human or animal
        consumption. Of the six major plant parts, seeds are the dominant
        source of human calories and protein. A wide variety of plant species
        provide edible seeds; most are angiosperms, while a few are
        gymnosperms. As a global food source, the most important edible seeds
        by weight are cereals, followed by legumes, nuts, then spices.
